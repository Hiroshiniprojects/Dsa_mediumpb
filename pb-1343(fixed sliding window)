Intuition
First categorize this problem into sliding window buy looking at the pattern fixed window size and asking the count for the number of sub array which satisfy the particular condition.

Approach
Sliding window pattern:constant or fixed window:
*Declare all the variables sum,count,l-leftside,r-rightside,avg
step1: have a for loop and get the summation of the fixed size array elements
step2:outside the first for loop check the avg with threshold if that is greater increase the count
step3:initialise the values l=0(2 pointers approach),r=k-1(since this places l in the leftmost part in the array and r in the first k-1 position)
step4:A while loop to iterate where r<n-1 until the last pos-1 so that when r is incremented no index outofbound error is caused.
step5:take the sum and reduce l value and increment the l to next pos step6:first increment r and then do the sum for r and then compute the avg and check if they are greater,count++.
step7:return count.

Complexity
Time complexity:
T(n)=O(n+n)-for first for loop and one while loop

Space complexity:
T(n)=O(1)

Code
class Solution {
    public int numOfSubarrays(int[] arr, int k, int threshold) {
        int sum=0;
        int count=0;
        float avg=0;
        int n=arr.length;
        for(int i=0;i<k;i++){
            sum+=arr[i];
            
        }
        avg=sum/k;
        if(avg>=threshold){
            count++;
        }
        int l=0;
        int r=k-1;
        while(r<n-1){
            sum=sum-arr[l];
            l++;
            r=r+1;
            sum=sum+arr[r];
            avg=sum/k;
            if(avg>=threshold){
                count++;
            }
            
        }
        return count;
    }
}
